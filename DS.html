      <p>I put a spanish tutorial due to the nonexistence of the DNI in the United Kingdom, so I couldn´t find one in the english language and the only way of giving you a video tutorial is this</p>
      
      <h3>·What is the electronic DNI?</h3>
          <p>The electronic DNI is a personal identification document issued by the Government of Spain. This represents a further step in the development of electronic administration in the country. The electronic DNI consists mainly of:</p>
            <p>-A chip with the personal data of its owner</p>
            <p>-Certificates for authentication and electronic signature.</p>
      <h3>·What information does the electronic DNI contain?</h3>
          <p>As we have commented, the electronic DNI contains in its small integrated circuit or microchip all the information necessary for the identification and signature of its holder. When we talk about an electronic signature through the electronic DNI, we are talking about a qualified electronic signature is being made. This category of signature is the one that offers the greatest legal guarantees, with the same recognition as the handwritten signature. We can break down this data into:</p>
            <p>-Personal data .</p>
            <p>-Digitized image of the photo.</p>
            <p>-Digitized image of the handwritten signature.</p>
            <p>-Cryptographic summary of the biometric fingerprint .</p>
            <p>-Authentication and electronic signature certificates.</p>
            <p>-Certificate of own component of the DNI.</p>
      <h3>·How do you sign with the electronic DNI?</h3>
          <p>You have to complete two simples steps:</p>
            <p>1º Comply with the requirements to sign with the electronic DNI</p>
            <p>First of all, we will have to check if we meet the minimum technical hardware and software requirements for its use. In the case of the electronic DNI, it will be mandatory to have a smart card reader, which can be integrated into the keyboard or connected to the computer via USB or PCMCIA card.</p>
            <p>If we are going to sign using a card reader, we will need to have a cryptographic module, which will be different depending on the operating system or browser, and the drivers of the reading device itself.</p>
            <p>Regarding software, DNI is prepared for use from any operating system, supporting the following Internet browsers:</p>
            <p>-Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 6.0 or higher)</p>
            <p>-Mozilla Firefox (version 1.5 or higher)</p>
            <p>-Netscape (version 4.78 or higher)</p>
            <p>2º Sign electronically from the application</p>
            <p>For the signature operation itself, we will have to open the document to be signed through the software solution with which we are going to make said signature. The process for the execution of this signature step by step will vary depending on the tool that we are going to use. In the case of Viafirma, it is a very simple and intuitive procedure. Whether using a card reader or NFC, the solution will recognize the certificate as one more within the system. You just have to choose it and use it. In general, you will have to select the document, which can be consulted prior to the signature, to later proceed with it, for which we will be required to have the verification PIN of our electronic DNI. A code that is provided to us when we obtain it and that we can modify if we wish.</p>
