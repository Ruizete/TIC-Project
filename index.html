        <p>Once explained this, I want to continue explaining what is Web 2.0, because it is a important concept to now nowadays</p> 
        <h2>What is Web 2.0?</h2>
        <p>Web 2.0 describes the current state of the web, which has more user-generated content and usability for end-users compared to its earlier incarnation, Web 1.0. In general, Web 2.0 refers to the Internet applications that have transformed the digital era in the aftermath of the dotcom bubble.</p>
        <p>Web 2.0 does not refer to any specific technical upgrades to the internet. It simply refers to a shift in how the Internet is used. In the new age of the Internet, there is a higher level of information sharing and interconnectedness among participants. This new version allows users to actively participate in the experience rather than just acting as passive viewers who take in information. </p>
