                <h4>·What is W3C?</h4>
                <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential</p>
                <h4>·What does W3C do?</h4>
                <p>W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work.</p>
                <h4>·Where is W3C located?</h4>
                <p>W3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).</p>
                <h4>·Does W3C design Web sites?</h4>
                <p>W3C is not in the business of designing Web sites.</p>
                <h4>·What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?</h4>
                <p>From the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."</p>
                <p>Thus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP standards.</p>
                <p>The Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."</p>
                <p>Thus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML</p>
