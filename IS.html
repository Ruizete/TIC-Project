        <h3>·The Mains Malwares:</h3> 
            <h4>-Computer virus:
                <p>It's designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document. In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data</p>     
            <h4>-Computer Worm:</h4> 
                <p>It's a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage. Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge. Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings.</p>
            <h4>-Trojan virus:</h4> 
                <p>It's a type of malicious code or software that looks legitimate but can take control of your computer. It is designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other harmful action on your data or network. It acts like a bona fide application or file to trick you. It seeks to deceive you into loading and executing the malware on your device. Once installed, a Trojan can perform the action it was designed for. It's sometimes called a Trojan virus or a Trojan horse virus, but that’s a misnomer. Viruses can execute and replicate themselves. A Trojan cannot. A user has to execute Trojans. Even so, Trojan malware and Trojan virus are often used interchangeably.</p>
            <h4>-Spyware:</h4> 
                <p>It's an unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users. Spyware is used for many purposes. Usually it aims to track and sell your internet usage data, capture your credit card or bank account information, or steal your personal identity. How? Spyware monitors your internet activity, tracking your login and password information, and spying on your sensitive information. Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device, so it’s important to use secure passwords and keep your devices updated. Spyware is one of the most common threats on the internet. It can easily infect your device and it can be hard to identify. Spyware is a threat to businesses and individual users, since it can steal sensitive information and harm your network.</p>
            
        <h3>·Types of Network Security:</h3>   
            <h4>-Access control and authentication measures:</h4> 
                <p>They protect networks and data by validating user credentials and ensuring that those users are only permitted to access the data that is necessary for their role. Tools that aid access control and authentication include privileged access management (PAM), Identity as a Service (IaaS) providers, and network access control (NAC) solutions.</p>
            <h4>-Anti-Virus:</h4> 
                <p>It's a prevention-based, that protects networks by proactively stopping endpoint devices from becoming infected.</p>
            <h4>-Anti-Malware:</h4> 
                <p>It's a treatment-based, that protects networks by detecting and destroying malicious programs that have infiltrated the network.</p>
            <h4>Application security:</h4> 
                <p>It ensures that the software used throughout the network is secure. Application security is ensured by limiting the amount of software that is used, ensuring that software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and that applications developed for use in the network are appropriately hardened against potential exploits.</p>    
            <h4>-Behavioral analytics:</h4> 
                <p>It's an advanced threat detection method that compares historical network activity data to current events in an effort to detect anomalous behavior. An example of this would be if a user typically uses a given endpoint device to access a specific database somewhere between 3-4 times per day on average, an instance where that user instead uses a new endpoint device to access a different database several times would be flagged for review.</p>      
            <h4>-Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS):</h4> 
                <p>It attacks attempt to crash the network by overloading it with a large influx of incoming connection requests. DDoS prevention solutions analyze incoming requests to identify and filter out illegitimate traffic in an effort to maintain the network’s accessibility for legitimate connections.</p>      
            <h4>-Data loss prevention (DLP):</h4> 
                <p>It's a tool that protect the data inside a network by preventing users from sharing sensitive or valuable information outside of the network and ensuring that data is not lost or misused. This can be accomplished by analyzing files that are sent via email, file transfers, and instant messages for data that is considered to be sensitive, such as personally identifiable information</p>      
            <h4>-Email security:</h4> 
                <p>It protects networks from phishing attacks that attempt to trick users into clicking links to malicious websites or downloading seemingly innocent attachments that introduce malware into the network. Email security tools proactively fight phishing by identifying suspicious emails and filtering them out before they reach the user’s inbox.</p>   
            <h4>-Endpoint security:</h4> 
                <p>It protects networks by ensuring that the devices that will be connected to the network are secured against potential threats. Endpoint security is achieved alongside network security by combining several other network security tools such as network access control, application security, and network monitoring.</p> 
            <h4>-Firewalls:</h4> 
                <p>They are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network. </p> 
            <h4>-Mobile device security:</h4> 
                <p>It centers around limiting the access that mobile devices have to the network and ensuring that the security vulnerabilities of mobile devices that are permitted on the network are monitored and managed.</p> 
            <h4>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):</h4> 
                <p>It scans network traffic for suspicious activity such as policy violations in an effort to automatically block intrusion attempts.</p> 
            <h4>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</h4> 
                <p>It works similarly to IPS, with an emphasis on monitoring network packets and flagging suspicious activity for review.</p> 
            <h4>Security Information And Event Management (SIEM):</h4> 
                <p>It provides a detailed overview of network events using a combination of host-based and network-based intrusion detection methods. SIEM systems provide administrators with valuable log data for investigating security incidents and flagging suspicious behavio</p> 
            <h4>Network segmentation:</h4> 
                <p>It's a common network security practice for reducing the ease of which network security threats can spread. Network segmentation involves classifying a larger network into multiple subnetworks, with each subnetwork being managed with its own unique access controls. Each subnetwork acts as its own unique network to improve monitoring capabilities, boost network performance, and enhance security.</p> 
            <h4>Virtual private networks:</h4> 
                <p>It provides secure remote access from a given endpoint into a network. A VPN encrypts all network traffic that goes through it to prevent the unauthorized analysis of data sent to and from the network. It is often used by off-site workers that need a secure connection to their company’s network, allowing them to access data and applications that are necessary for their role.</p>
            <h4>Web security:</h4> 
                <p>It protects networks by proactively protecting endpoint devices against web-based threats. Web security technologies such as a web filter will use a database of known malicious or vulnerable websites to maintain a blacklist, block commonly exploited network ports, and prevent users from engaging in high-risk activities on the internet.</p> 
            <h4>Wireless security:</h4> 
                <p>It protects the network against vulnerabilities that are unique to wireless connections. Wi-Fi networks openly broadcast connections to nearby devices, creating added opportunities for nearby threat actors to attempt to access the network. Wireless security is enhanced through methods such as encrypting data passed over wireless networks, filtering MAC addresses to restrict access, and privatizing the network SSID to avoid broadcasting the name of the network.</p> 
         <h3>·Network protocols:</h3>     
            <h4>-SSL</h4><p>SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).</p> 
            <h4>-HTTPS</h4><p>HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. The details of the certificate, including the issuing authority and the corporate name of the website owner, can be viewed by clicking on the lock symbol on the browser bar.</p> 
            <h4>-IPv6</h4><p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which identifies devices across the internet so they can be located. Every device that uses the internet is identified through its own IP address in order for internet communication to work. In that respect, it’s just like the street addresses and zip codes you need to know in order to mail a letter.</p>
         <h3>·Digital Signatures</h3>
             <p>It's an electronic "password" that allows a person, organizaion to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Digital Certificate is also known as a public key certificate or identity certificate.</p>
         <h3>·Certificate Authorities</h3>
             <p>It's a trusted organization that verifies websites (and other entities) so that you know who you’re communicating with online. Their objective is to make the internet a more secure place for organizations and users alike. This means that they play a pivotal role in digital security.</p>
